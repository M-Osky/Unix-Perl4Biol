# Unix-Perl4Biol
More advanced Perl scripts, mostly just exercises, and few personal scripts

Most of the scripts are done solvving the exercises from "Unix and Perl Primer for Biologists - Keith Bradnam & Ian Korf".
The exercises are explained briefly in UNIX/Exercices, but each exercice is in an independent script and the information on each file should be enough.
PERLinfo includes all the commands and tips I used for those scripts
I usually either execute/call them from Cygwin in windows, or execute them from Notepad++
