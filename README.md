# Unix-Perl4Biol
More advanced Perl scripts, mostly just exercises, and few personal scripts

UnixCommands.txt includes most of the Unix commands, tips and exercises from "Unix and Perl Primer for Biologists - Keith Bradnam & Ian Korf".
The exercises are explained briefly in "UnixCommands.txt", but each exercice is in an independent script and the information on each file should be explanatory.
Almost all the Perl tips from the above course were added to learn-perl(dot)org.txt in my Perl_tutorials Repository in order to have all the Perl information together.
