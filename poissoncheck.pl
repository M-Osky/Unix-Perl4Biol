#***********Background********** 
#	We have variation in the depht of coverage of a genome alignment. We could expect and have a common regular depht of coverage (10x), but at some times we can have lower or higher values (5x and 20x); this could be a random fluctuation, or the lower values (5x) could correspond to an haploid region and the higher (20x) to a duplication.

#	With the Poisson distribution we will calculate how likely a given coverage (5X OR 20X) is given an expected value of coverage (10x)

#	The Poisson distribution has two parameters: lambda and k.
#		Lambda is an integer greater than zero. It is both the mean (expected value) and the variance. In our case, lambda can be 10. 
#		k is a non-negative integer. It corresponds with the number of observations seen. This can be 5 or 20. In addition we could use 0 to check if areas of the genome with no reads aligned to them is just by stochastic reasons or there is biological reasons under the Poisson model.
