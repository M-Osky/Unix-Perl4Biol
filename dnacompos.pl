#	Project 1: DNA composition

#***********Background********** 
#	The program will read a sequence and determine its length and composition: 
#    length of the sequence
#    total number of A, C, G, and T nucleotides
#    fraction of A, C, G, and T nucleotides (i.e. %A, %C etc.)
#    GC fraction
